Benchmarks easily modifiable to use futures instead of thrds:
    matmul, trapr
    fact (without fact-thrd-ref)
    atoms, stm (without definition of atomic functions)

Benchmarks modified to use futures instead of thrds:
    bchain, count, dekker, fact, mcarlo, mceval, minimax, msort, pc, pp, rng, stm, sudoku

Benchmarks now using lists instead of vectors:
    bchain, pp, sudoku

Benchmarks using references (to be replaced by atoms):
    qsort, tsp, sieve, ringbuf, pps, pp, phild, pc, mg, nbody, life, fact, dekker, count, atoms, abp

Benchmarks now using atoms instead of references:
    actors, bchain, dekker, fact, pc, pp, rng, stm

Benchmarks using locks (to be implemented on top of atoms):
    abp, actors, atoms, bchain, count, fact, life, pc, phild, pp, tsp, stm

    Lock prelude:

    (define (t/new-lock) (atom #f))
    (define (t/acquire lock)
      (let try ()
        (if (compare-and-set! lock #f #t)
            #t
            (try))))
    (define (t/release lock)
      (reset! lock #f))
