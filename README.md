Scala-AM: A Framework for Static Analysis of Dynamic Languages

**Note:**

We have shifted the focus of our research to studying modular static analyses.
As a result, Scala-AM has been thorougly overhauled to support this kind of analyses, and the framework resurrected as MAF, the [Modular Analysis Framework](https://github.com/softwarelanguageslab/maf).
Like Scala-AM, MAF is a modular framework for static analysis of dynamic languages, but it is geared towards (experimenting with) modular analysis techniques.
MAF is available [here](https://github.com/softwarelanguageslab/maf).

# Goal
The goal of this artefact is to experiment with abstract machines and language
semantics. Currently, the artefact's implementation is focused towards experiments with modular analyses.
Additionally, semantics for R5RS Scheme are present.

# Usage
The Scala-AM framework can be used in several ways.

## Using the JavaScript visual front-end
The framework includes a JavaScript front-end that can be used to visualise a MODF analysis in the browser.
To run this visualisation, open the file `scalaam.html` with your browser. The visualisation provides information with
regard to the work list (coloured in light blue) and currently analysed component (coloured in dark blue).
Stepping through the visualisation can be done using the space bar.

If you need to compile the code first, run the command `fastOptJS` within your sbt repl.

## Analysing a program using command line
The Scala-AM framework is built in a modular style. To run a modular analysis, you need to compose the
implementation of a specific machine and an abstract domain.

To analyze a specific program, an instance of the MODF analysis class must be created. The constructor of
this class takes a parsed version of the program to be analysed, which can be obtained as follows:
```scala
val text = io.Reader.loadFile(path-to-file)
val prog = language.scheme.Schemeparser.parse(text)
```
Additional preprocessing steps are performed by the modular analysis itself and hence must not be performed manually.

Now, the MODF instance can be created. For example, to analyze `prog` using a big-step MODF analysis
with full argument sensitivity and a type domain:
```scala
val machine = new ModAnalysis(prog) with BigStepSemantics
                                    with StandardSchemeModFSemantics
                                    with FullArgumentSensitivity
                                    with TypePropagationDomain
machine.analyze()
```
The `analyze` function can take an optional parameter to specify a timeout, which is obtained from a Java Duration
like `Timeout.start(duration)`. The analysis will stop approximately when the timeout has been reached, that is,
the analysis may be run a bit longer than is specified by the timeout, but never shorter unless it finishes.

Currently, no explicit result is returned by the analysis. Rather, information can be retrieved by fields of the machine,
such as the final store and dependencies between components.

# Running the test suite
This repository is monitored by a CI-system. Upon every push and pull request to this repository, the test suite is run on a specific subset of benchmark programs (Scala-AM tests on action). 
In addition, the full test suite is run over night (Daily Scala-AM tests).

Current status:

![Latest build](https://github.com/acieroid/scala-am/workflows/Scala-AM%20tests%20on%20action/badge.svg) 
![Nightly tests](https://github.com/acieroid/scala-am/workflows/Daily%20Scala-AM%20tests/badge.svg)

The full test suite of Scala-AM can easily be run manually using sbt:
```sbtshell
scalaam/test
```

To allow specific tests to be run, tags have been added to the test suite. 
 * Following tags can be used to select the component of the framework that should (not) be tested: `ParserTest`, `LatticeTest`, `PrimitiveTest` and `SoundnessTest`.
 * Following tags can be used to select which benchmark programs (not) to run: `SlowTest`.

The `SlowTest` tag currently is only used for some of the soundness tests. When these tests are disabled, only a part of the available benchmark programs
will be used.

To run tests with a specific tag, the sbt command `scalaam/testOnly` should be used. The `-n` flag indicates test tags that should be
included from testing, whereas the `-l` flag indicates tags that should be excluded from testing.

For example, to run the parser tests, the following command can be used:
```sbt
scalaam/testOnly -- -n ParserTest
```
(Note the double -- before any possible flags.)<br>
To run all soundness tests, but only on a fast subset of benchmark programs, the command
```sbt
scalaam/testOnly -- -n SoundnessTest -l SlowTest
```
can be executed.

# References and Relevant publications
The original idea behind Scala-AM comes from the [Abstracting Abstract Machines](http://matt.might.net/papers/vanhorn2010abstract.pdf)
literature. Since then, the work of [Effect-Driven Flow Analysis](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-11245-5_12) has been integrated.
